NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN

/**
 Performs an application-initiated interaction in which the user can select a choice from the passed choice set.

 There are several ways to present a choice set: as visual pop-up menu (with an optional keyboard that allows for searches), as voice-recognition (VR) only menu, or as both a VR and visual menu. It is also possible to present only the keyboard for doing searches.

 A choice set can have up to 100 items, however if you are presenting a visual only menu please be aware that the OEM may choose to limit the number of presented choices when the driver is distracted (i.e. the car is moving).

 A VR-only menu could be used to ask a user to say the name of a song to play. The user's response would only be valid if it appears in the specified choice set.
 A visual popup-menu could be used to present a list of albums to the user. The user would select the album they want to play from the list of presented choices.
 A keyboard can be used for searches. For example, the user could be asked to enter the name of a restaurant. The name can be used to search for local restaurants with the same name. When the search is completed another menu can be presented with a list of potential addresses for the destination.

 If connecting to SDL Core v.6.0+, the perform interaction can be canceled programmatically using the `cancelID`. On older versions of SDL Core, the perform interaction will persist until the user has interacted with the perform interaction or the specified timeout has elapsed.
