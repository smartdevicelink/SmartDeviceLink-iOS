/// A dynamic version of the NSArray `hash` method. The default `hash` method returns the number of objects in the array as its hash and this leads to clashes between arrays with the same number of objects.
/// Instead, this method calls hash on each of it's sub-objects, XOR and rotates them, then returns this as the hash. This is much slower than the default hash method, but sometimes necessary to properly compare arrays.
/// @returns A hash based on the hashes of all of the contained objects
