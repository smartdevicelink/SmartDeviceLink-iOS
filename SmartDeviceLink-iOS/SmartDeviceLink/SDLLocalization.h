/**
 Provides localization features fully compatible to the existing localization structure of iOS.

 In addition to stock localization features it supports the fallback to other localizations which enables
 the app to partly implement localizations for regions. This will improve maintenance for region based
 localizations.
 
 An app may contain a lproj for "en" and "en-GB" whereof "en-GB" is only a subset of "en" overwriting
 only specific keys which doesn't match the regular "en" localization. An object of this localization class
 will try out to to localize a key from "en-GB" first and if it fails it then tries "en".
 
 Furthermore a specific language and its localization can be loaded besides the phone language.
 
 The class is fully plural rule enabled using the existing strucutre of stringsdict files.
