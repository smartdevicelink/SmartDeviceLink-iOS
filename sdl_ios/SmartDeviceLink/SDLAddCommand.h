 * <li>When a SDLCommand is added with no SDLMenuParams value provided</li>
 * <li>When a SDLMenuParams value is provided with a SDLMenuParam.position value
 * greater than or equal to the number of menu items currently defined in the
 * menu specified by the SDLMenuParam.parentID value</li>

 * The set of choices which the application builds using SDLAddCommand can be a
 * mixture of:
 * <li>Choices having only VR synonym definitions, but no SDLMenuParams definitions

 * <li>Choices having only SDLMenuParams definitions, but no VR synonym definitions
