/**
 * <p>Notifies an application that HMI conditions have changed for the application. This indicates whether the application
 * can speak phrases, display text, perform interactions, receive button presses and events, stream audio, etc. This
 * notification will be sent to the application when there has been a change in any one or several of the indicated
 * states (<i>SDLHMILevel</i>, <i>SDLAudioStreamingState</i> or <i>SDLSystemContext</i>) for the application</p>
 * <p>All three values are, in principle, independent of each other (though there may be some relationships). A value for
 * one parameter should not be interpreted from the value of another parameter.</p>
 * <p>There are no guarantees about the timeliness or latency of the SDLOnHMIStatus notification. Therefore, for example,
 * information such as <i>SDLAudioStreamingState</i> may not indicate that the audio stream became inaudible to the user
 * exactly when the SDLOnHMIStatus notification was received.</p>

 * When this parameter has a value of NOT_AUDIBLE,
 * the application must stop streaming audio to SDL.
 * Informs app whether any currently streaming audio is
 * audible to user (AUDIBLE) or not (NOT_AUDIBLE). A
 * value of NOT_AUDIBLE means that either the
 * application's audio will not be audible to the user, or
 * that the application's audio should not be audible to
 * the user (i.e. some other application on the mobile
 * device may be streaming audio and the application's
 * audio would be blended with that other audio). </td>
