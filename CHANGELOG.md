# 4.0.2 Release Notes

### Bug Fixes
* Debug logging is a bit better designed and is faster, and file logging happens on a separate queue.
* IAP code no longer causes an unnecessary 3 minute background timer to be set. External Accessory applications already get all the background time they need.
* SDLProxyListener delegate callbacks had some misnamed parameters 'request' should be 'response'.
* SDLProxyListener was marking the wrong type for a passed delegate object. `onOnLockScreenNotification:` now correctly passes a type `SDLOnLockScreenStatus` instead of an `SDLLockScreenStatus`.
* Return `nil` if an object was never set to an RPC. This fixes many unit tests.
* Don't allow `SDLRPCStruct` to initialize with a `nil` backing store. This fixes unit tests.
* MTU size has been fixed to be base 8 based instead of base 10.

### Other
* Apple broke SDL's app launching scheme in iOS 9.0, so this code has been removed from the project. Apple fixed a bug in iOS 9.2 that alleviates much of the missing functionality.
* The example app no longer has video and audio code, and its app type is now `MEDIA` instead of `NAVIGATION`.
* Travis CI builds are fixed
* Pull-Request and Issue templates have been added

# 4.0.1 Release notes

## Release Candidate 1 (2015-09-19)

### Enhancements
* Lock screen icon is now fetched
* Hex string parsing is now roughly twice as fast.

### Bug Fixes
* Web request delegates weren't always called.
* Streaming audio fixes.

## Alpha 2 (2015-06-04)

### API Breaking Changes
* 28 header files moved to 'project' scope, making them unavailable to developers.
* Headers now use class forwarding (`@class`) instead of full imports whenever possible.
* SDLDebugToolConsole is given its own file
* SDLRPCStruct is given its own file
* SDLHMIZoneCapablities, SDLVRCapabilities, SDLVRHelpItem letter case fixed
* Fixed 'persistent' spelling and removed 'sync' in `+[SDLRPCRequestFactory buildPutFileWithFileName:fileType:persistentFile:correlationID:]`
* Removed unused ISDLProxy protocol and file
* SDLHMILevel enum names altered to match the rest of the enums
* Fixed spelling of SDLProxyListener `onEncodedSyncPDataResponse:` method
* SDLRPCRequestFactory `buildRegisterAppInterfaceWithAppName:ttsName:vrSynonyms:isMediaApp:languageDesired:hmiDisplayLanguageDesired:appID:` to take immutable arrays instead of mutable arrays, to match all the other methods
* Removed SDLTransport protocol and file
* Removed SDLInterfaceProtocol protocol and file

### Enhancements
* Completely new project structure. This will enable future support for optional packages through Cocoapods (via subspecs) and frameworks
* Cocoapods distribution support
* Carthage distribution support
* Add a very basic example app
* Unit tests, using Quick, Nimble, and OCMock third party libraries (only used for unit testing)
* Partial documentation coverage
* Enable static analysis
* Initializers now return `instancetype`
* SDLEnums store values in an immutable NSArray
* Add initializers to SDLObjectWithPriority
* Add a `.clang-format` file
* Add SDLHMICapabilities struct
* Add new enum values for TextFieldName, ImageFieldName, KeyboardEvent, Result, and RequestType
* Add SDLSendLocation RPC
* Add SDLDialNumber RPC
* Add quicklook support to SDLEnum objects
* Protocols now conform to NSObject
* Add new RegisterAppInterfaceResponse parameters
* Add support for SDL 4.0 app launching
* Refactor IAP transport
* Add thread index to log format

### Bugfixes

* Fix all instances of 'receive' being spelled incorrectly
* Fix attempting to copy an SDLEnum in `+[SDLRPCRequestFactory buildPutFileWithFileName:fileType:persistentFile:correlationId:]`
* Fix SDLProtocolHeader `data` method using incorrect order of operations (#84)
* Fix SDLOnLockScreenStatus `hmiLevel` checking wrong class type (#83)
* Fix SDLProtocolMessageAssembler calling it's completion handler twice (#92)

* Fix OnSyncPData function ID being incorrect
* Fix uninitialized variable being captured by a block in SDLProxy
* Fix misspelling of 'dictionary'
